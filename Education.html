<p> UiTM Kedah was inaugurated on 1 October 1997 by YB Tun Daim Zainuddin, Minister of Finance. The campus began its first operations in November 1997 with 162 students and 25 administrative staff.
The campus has an area of 350 acres in Mukim Bujang (between Semeling and Merbok), which is located about 14 kilometers from Sungai Petani and was developed based on the approval of the 6th Malaysian Budget Plan with a total of RM38.4 million.
The establishment of this campus is based on a master plan that takes into account a maximum capacity of 7000 students. My journey at this campus started in August 2021 where at that time I was eligible to continue my studies at the IPT level in the department of Library Management
under the Faculty of Information Management until now in 2023 now I am in the final semester. My presence here has produced many sweet memories whether in assignments or memories with friends.</p>

<p> Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Iskandar or SMK Seri Iskandar for short, is a national secondary school located in Seri Iskandar.
SMEKSI was officially opened on 2.7.2001 with code AEA 8008 SM Rural Grade B. This school was built to meet the needs of the people around Seri Iskandar who have been attending school
at SMK Dato'Abdul Rahman Yaakub whose students almost reached 1800 around the year 2000. It is also to meet the needs of students at SK Seri Iskandar whose number of students is increasing.
In addition, there are 2 study centers namely UiTM and UTP as well as the rapid development in Bandar Baru Seri Iskandar with the opening of new housing estates in the surrounding area.
In terms of its curriculum, this school offers the main subjects at the lower secondary and upper secondary levels like other schools throughout Malaysia. Just an introduction to
Vocational subjects were added to form 4 students in 2001, namely Landscape and Nursery and Sign Design. The same goes for Music Education subjects
introduced in the same year for grade 1 and grade 2 students in selected classes. In terms of staffing, in 2008, 4 heads of fields were appointed for SM Grade B ie
Language, Humanities, Science & Mathematics and Vocational & Technical fields to further strengthen school management in SM Grade B. From April 8, 2010 Special Plan Classes were established by placing as many
54 grade 1 students in two classes. Until now, the Special Plan Class involves grade 1 to 3 students with a capacity of 2 classes for each grade. Special Education began to be established on
January 2011 with 5 students and 2 teachers. In 2021, all original students from 3 kacapuri schools, namely from SK Suak Padi, SK Tumbuh Warmat and SK Gedung Batu have moved to SMK Dato' Abdul Rahman Yaakub (SMKDARY).
In 2021 the number of students increased to 1183 and the number of teachers totaled 90. While the Special Education Stream students are 35 people.
<br>
My experience at this school began in 2016 when I was 13 years old, Form 1 until I finished my schooling at the age of 17, Form 5. After moving in
Form 4, I was absorbed into the Technical Science class where the elective subjects were Additional Mathematics, Business and Technical Communication Graphics.
In 2018, i.e. during Form 3, the year began where the second biggest exam in a student's life in Malaysia is PT3 (Assessment Form 3)
which will be a yardstick to determine the direction of students in different classes according to their level of achievement in this exam. For this exam
i have got 7A 2B and 1D results. While for the next exam in Form 5, which is SPM (Malaysian Examination Certificate), the results I got for 9 registered subjects were
6 A and 2B which was when the Covid-19 Pandemic occurred which caused the school to be closed for a few months, but thank God I was still given the opportunity to make my parents proud. </p>
